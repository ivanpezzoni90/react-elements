# React Interface Components

Simple (and incomplete) list of React Components built from scratch and written in TypeScript, with customizable properties.

It's available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-interface-elements) as npm package.

There is a [playground](https://react-interface-element.vercel.app/) to style the elements with different properties.

Include the components in your app
```
import {Input} from 'react-interface-elements';
```
Style components with properties (To see the element and its props in action use the [playground](https://react-interface-element.vercel.app/))

```
<Input
    label="My Input"
    type="text"
    onChange={() => {}}
/>
```

Download the Playground React app from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ivanpezzoni90/react-elements) and run
### `npm install`
### `npm start`
